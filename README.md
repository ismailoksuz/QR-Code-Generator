Simple QR Code Generator (HTML/CSS/JS)

🌟 Overview

This is a minimalist, dark-themed QR Code Generator built with HTML (index.html), CSS (style.css), and JavaScript (script.js). The project is structured into three separate, clean files for better organization and maintainability. It is designed for maximum simplicity, requiring no backend or complex build steps—just open the main file, index.html, in any modern web browser.
